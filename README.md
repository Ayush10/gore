# GORE
## Go renamer

GORE is a bulk file renamer written in Go as a personal project to learn programming.

What's been done so far: it creates a temporary file with all the files and directories names on it.

End goal: Run GORE in the current directory and it will create a temporary file with all the files in the current directory listed on it and open it in $EDITOR so you can change the names and save. It will rename every file you changed.
